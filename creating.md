# Adding new models to PMR

_You've created a new model, or made a CellML file for a model that doesn't have one yet, and now you'd like to share it with the world._

## Step 1: Uploading your model

1. First, it's not called the CellML repository, it's the Physiome (Model) Repository (PMR), and you should be using the URL https://models.physiomeproject.org.

2. Go to https://models.physiomeproject.org, create an account, and log in.

3. Follow this [official guide to uploading new models](https://aucklandphysiomerepository.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html). Roughly, you will:
    - Create a "workspace" (a git repository) where your model and meta data files live.
    - Create an "exposure" (a git tag) of your workspace, and make it publically viewable. 

In the last step you will be given the option to select documentation files for both your exposure and any model files.
If you have only one model, don't select documentation for the exposure itself, just for the model file.
