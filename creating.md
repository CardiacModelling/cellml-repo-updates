# Adding new models to PMR

_You've created a new model, or made a CellML file for a model that doesn't have one yet, and now you'd like to share it with the world._

## Step 1: Uploading your model

1. First, it's not called the CellML repository, it's the Physiome (Model) Repository (PMR), and you should be using the URL https://models.physiomeproject.org.

2. Go to https://models.physiomeproject.org, create an account, and log in.

3. Follow this [official guide to uploading new models](https://aucklandphysiomerepository.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html)

## Step 2: Adding your model to the ephys model list

1. Extra steps are needed to add your model to the "electrophysiology" list of models (https://models.physiomeproject.org/electrophysiology).

2. TODO: DESCRIBE THESE HERE

## Step 3: Bother a curator

1. Get Gary or Michael to email Andre (who's name is David). Or do it yourself.
   - Make sure to include the PMR URL of your (forked) workspace 

2. If all goes well, Andre (or another curator) can
   - pull in your changes to some curated workspace
   - create a new exposure
   - "expire" the old exposure, causing the new one to show up in searches etc. instead
