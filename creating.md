# Adding new models to PMR

_You've created a new model, or made a CellML file for a model that doesn't have one yet, and now you'd like to share it with the world._

## Step 1: Uploading your model

1. First, it's not called the CellML repository, it's the Physiome (Model) Repository (PMR), and you should be using the URL https://models.physiomeproject.org.

2. Go to https://models.physiomeproject.org, create an account, and log in.

3. Follow this [official guide to uploading new models](https://aucklandphysiomerepository.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html). Roughly, you will:
  - Create a "workspace" (a git repository) where your model and meta data files live.
  - Create an "exposure" (a git tag) of your workspace, and make it publically viewable. 

## Step 2: Adding your model to the ephys model list

See [listing.md](./listing.md).
